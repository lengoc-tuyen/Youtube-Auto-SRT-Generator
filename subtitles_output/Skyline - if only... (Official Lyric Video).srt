1
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,979
Maybe I was just too blind to see

2
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,100
All the spaces between you and me

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Thinkin′ we were magical, we're meant to be

4
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:55,899
If only I heard what you gotta say

5
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,719
Wish that I could just turn back the time

6
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,920
Back when I was yours and you were mine

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,579
Hoping we′ll get better, we'll be fine somehow

8
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,079
By now

9
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:29,780
If only we don't choose to go

10
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:36,980
And stay a bit longer

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,730
Would things stay the same?

12
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,799
If only there′s another chance

13
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,299
I′ll make it all okay

14
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,919
Don't walk away

15
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,319
Now I′m just a guy with made-up fantasies

16
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,819
With all my dreams and possibilities

17
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,319
Trimmin' all the memories, ′cos you broke me when you leave

18
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,819
If only we don't choose to go

19
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,319
And stay a bit longer

20
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,819
Would things stay the same?

21
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,319
If only there′s another chance

22
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,819
I'll make it all okay

23
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,319
Don't walk away
